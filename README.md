# JarisX Documentation
## Introduction
JarisX can perform mathematical operations, string manipulations, date and time operations, and file and directory operations.


## Mathematical Operations
add(a, b): Prints and returns the sum of a and b.
subtract(a, b): Prints and returns the difference of a and b.
multiply(a, b): Prints and returns the product of a and b.
divide(a, b): Prints and returns the quotient of a divided by b. If b is 0, it prints an error message.
power(a, b): Prints and returns a raised to the power of b.
square_root(a): Prints and returns the square root of a.
factorial(n): Prints and returns the factorial of n.
fibonacci(n): Prints and returns the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
String Manipulations
palindrome_check(word): Checks if a word is a palindrome and prints the result.
reverse_string(string_to_reverse): Reverses a string and prints the result.
length_of_string(string_to_measure): Returns the length of a string and prints the result.
convert_to_uppercase(string_to_convert): Converts a string to uppercase and prints the result.

## Date and Time Operations
current_date(): Returns the current date and prints it.
current_time(): Returns the current time and prints it.
day_of_week(): Returns the current day of the week and prints it.

## File and Directory Operations
create_file(filename): Creates a file with the given filename and prints a confirmation message.
write_to_file(filename, content): Writes content to a file with the given filename and prints a confirmation message.
read_file(filename): Reads content from a file with the given filename and prints it.
delete_file(filename): Deletes a file with the given filename and prints a confirmation message.
list_files(directory): Lists all files in a directory and prints them.
make_directory(directory_name): Creates a directory with the given name and prints a confirmation message.
remove_directory(directory_name): Removes a directory with the given name and prints a confirmation message.
search_files(directory, filename_searched): Searches for files with a specific name in a directory and its subdirectories, then prints any matches found.

## Usage
To use this assistant, create an instance of the Assistant class and call its functions as needed. For example:

~~~
assistant = Assistant()
assistant.add(1, 2)
assistant.current_date()
~~~


## Conclusion
JarisX is designed to provide basic utility functions. It can be extended or modified as needed to suit your specific requirements. Happy coding!
